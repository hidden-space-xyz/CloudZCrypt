/// <summary>
/// Provides a Twofish-256 authenticated encryption implementation using Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
/// over the Twofish block cipher via the BouncyCastle library.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Twofish (an AES finalist) offers algorithmic diversity through its Feistel structure and
/// key-dependent S-box design philosophy. This service derives a 256-bit key from a password
/// (through a selected key derivation strategy) and applies AEAD semantics using GCM to supply
/// confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
/// <para>
/// Although GCM was not originally standardized around Twofish, its use here provides a familiar
/// authenticated encryption construction; however, hardware acceleration is typically limited
/// compared to AES, potentially affecting performance.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Example usage (conceptual):
/// <code language="csharp">
/// IEncryptionAlgorithmStrategy strategy = new TwofishEncryptionService(keyDerivationFactory);
/// bool ok = await strategy.EncryptFileAsync(
///     sourceFilePath: "plain.bin",
///     destinationFilePath: "secret.twofish",
///     password: userPassword,
///     keyDerivationAlgorithm: KeyDerivationAlgorithm.Argon2id);
