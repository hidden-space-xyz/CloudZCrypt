## 🧩 About the Name

CloudZCrypt originated from its initial purpose: creating a tool that would encrypt files securely for cloud storage services. The name combines "Cloud" (representing cloud storage), "Z" (as a stylistic element), and "Crypt" (for encryption). While the application was originally designed for securing files before uploading them to any cloud storage service, it works equally well for encrypting files stored locally on your device, offering versatile protection regardless of where your files ultimately reside.

## 🔍 Security Notes

- 🔑 Your security depends on your password strength - use long, complex passwords
- 🔄 Keep your operating system and CloudZCrypt updated
